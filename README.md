## What is tahskr?
tahskr is a simple, open source, self-hosted todo manager.

There are two parts to tahskr. The [**server side**](https://github.com/Dullage/tahskr-server) that stores and serves data and the **frontend** (that's this repo) that provides a web interface accessible from a mobile/desktop browser or Windows Electron app.
